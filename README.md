# Fraudulent-Reviews-Detector
In the era of e-commerce, the influence of online reviews on consumer behavior cannot be overstated. As customers, we rely on these reviews to make purchase decisions. This is an intelligent system that detects fake reviews by analyzing linguistic cues, sentiment, and review patterns. Empowering platforms and consumers to trust authentic feedback.
# Project Objective:
**1.** Detect fake or misleading reviews in bulk.
**2.** Provide categorized insights and visual analytics for informed decision-making.
**3.** Enhance trust and transparency in e-commerce marketplaces.
# Scope:
With advancing technologies and increasing competition, the e-commerce industry is constantly evolving. No 
matter what these changes are, the future of this robust and flourishing sector is bright and promising. The 
basic target to build a system-based **Sentiment analysis** is to accurately extract people's comments from a large 
number of unstructured review texts and classifying them into **sentiment classes**, i.e., positive, negative, or 
neutral. Sometimes “highly positive” and “highly negative” are also considered. In addition to defining the 
sentiment analysis of reviews of different products for example the one with high rate of review and with high 
price will show at the top of the rest of product. 
# Purpose:
The purpose of developing a fraudulent fake review detection system using machine learning is to address a 
significant problem in the online marketplace. With the increasing reliance on online reviews, it has become 
easier for fraudsters to manipulate the reviews and ratings for their own gain, such as promoting their products, 
services, or businesses while discrediting their competitors. 
# Proposed solution:
The proposed solution for fraudulent fake review detection using machine learning aims to improve upon the 
limitations of existing solutions in the market. The proposed solution will use a machine learning algorithm to 
detect potentially fake reviews, based on various features of the review, such as the language used, the 
reviewer's profile, the rating given, and the sentiment expressed.
